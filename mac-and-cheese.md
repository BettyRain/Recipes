## Level up
Do any/all of the following:
* Change the cheese sauce to use higher quality cheeses, mixed into a roux with an emulsifier like sodium citrate.
* Add a crispy topping like breadcrumbs during the baking process. If you do this, make sure to broil towards the end to really make the top crispy.
* Add extra ingredients like bacon into the body of the mac and cheese.

## Common Questions
* Why use Kraft Deli Deluxe American Cheese?
   * Kraft Deli Deluxe American Cheese contains emulsifiers that thicken the cheese sauce. The emulsifiers help create a very smooth texture that is more difficult to replicate using a roux.
