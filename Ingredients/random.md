* Salted or Unsalted butter?
   * Only difference is salt content in the cream.
   * Use unsalted butter for better control of the exact salt levels in the dish. Otherwise use salted butter.
   * Salt is a preservative. Unsalted butter does not store (3 months) as long as salted butter (5 months) in the fridge.
