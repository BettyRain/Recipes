# Potato
## Types
- Russett

## Selection
- Potatoes must be firm to the touch
- No dark spots or soft spots
- No visible gashes
- No green on the skin - contain solanine which is toxic
- No sprouting - indicates potato is old

## Storage
- Keep in dark, cool, dry place.
- Light causes production of toxic solanine (greenness)
- Don't refridgerate potatoes - starch will convert into sugar
- Moisture causes rotting
